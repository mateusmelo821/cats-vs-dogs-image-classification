# README

This is a data science project that made use of a dataset containing pictures of dogs and cats to build an image classifier. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (tensorflow, keras, numpy and matplotlib), Jupyter notebooks, convolutional neural networks, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/cats-vs-dogs-image-classification/).
